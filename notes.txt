Adjusting for screen size:
Not all that different from what you would do with canvas.
But one nice thing is that it is easy to move the camera to adjust what is
visible in the viewport.

You could do some math to calculate the z position of the camera
such that all of your content will be in the viewport.
You would need to take into consideration the fov and aspect ratio of your camera.
... However in many cases you will probably just change camera distance manually.
